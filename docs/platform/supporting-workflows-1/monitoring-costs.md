# Keeping track of costs

## Dashboard View

The dashboard page shows a graph of runs and interactive sessions and associated costs. You can also see what is currently active.

{% hint style="info" %}
All costs are estimates until runs or Sessions are complete
{% endhint %}

Runs and Sessions pages also show the cost per experiment and cost of each session; the dashboard is the easiest way to see the costs.

## Low Balance Warning

If the balance goes below $10, Grid will warn you about "low balance remaining"

Zero balance will prompt a shut down of interactive sessions as well as active runs.
