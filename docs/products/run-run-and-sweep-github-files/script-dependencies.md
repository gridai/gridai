## Handling Requirements

Anytime you run a project with Grid, we attempt to resolve as many dependencies as we can automatically for you. 

However, we recommend that your projects have a requirements.txt file in the root

{% hint style="info" %}
Grid does not \*yet support loading requirements.txt from a non-root locations
{% endhint %}
